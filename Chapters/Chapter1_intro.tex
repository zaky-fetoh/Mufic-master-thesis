\section{Novel Coronavirus Disease}

COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory tract infections which can range from mild to lethal \cite{acter2020evolution}. COVID-19 is contagious disease that can readily spread through direct or indirect contact with an infected person \cite{singhal2020review}. COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 initially appeared in Wuhan, China late 2019 and spread world wide \cite{hui2020continuing}. World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as Public Health Emergency of International Concern on  January 2020, and a pandemic on March 2020 \cite{platto2020covid19}.
Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infections have not only devastated human lives but also significantly damaged the financial health of both developing and developed countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to control the pandemic by accelerating the development and mass production of efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare practitioners, researchers, and policymakers around the globe were thrown a challenge to deliver adequate prevention and treatment modalities to combat the pandemic. From the initial stage of this pandemic, scientists were focused on either repurposing the existing drugs or developing vaccines against COVID-19 \cite{le2020evolution}. Fig. \ref{NorCovCXR} illustrates the difference between the COVID-19 and normal lungs.

Typical diagnostic tools for COVID-19 are virusâ€™ nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab \cite{tahamtan2020real}.  These manual traditional methods are time-consuming and complex. Chest X-rays (CXR) and chest CT offer fast screening methods for COVID-19 \cite{salehi2020coronavirus}\cite{wu2020new}\cite{zu2020coronavirus}. CXR and chest CT are preferred when RT-PCR testing is not available in time \cite{erickson1993advanced}. CXR has many advantages over chest CT including the widespread of the acquisition devices, low cost, and the speed of the acquisition\cite{narin2021automatic}\cite{brenner2007computed}\cite{rubin2020role}\cite{shi2020review}. These advantages lead CXR to be a fixed routine for hindering COVID-19 spread.

\section{Motivation}
Fig. \ref{hospitalRoutine} illustrates typical Egyptian hospitals routine for reducing COVID-19 spread among healthcare workers. This process is performed for every visitor of the hospital. Phases of CBC Test and PCR test are automated and does not consume time. While CXR image diagnosing involves human factor which act a bottleneck of the process. This process can be fully automated using image classification models. As a consequence \textit{1)} Total time required for every visitor will be reduced. \textit{2)} Work load of radiologist is reduced.

Deep learning \cite{lecun2015deep} models, namely convolutional Neural Network (CNN) \cite{lecun1989handwritten}, have shown a great performance in computer vision problems such as object detection \cite{erhan2014scalable}\cite{girshick2014rich}\cite{sermanet2013overfeat}\cite{redmon2016you} and object recognition \cite{simonyan2014very}\cite{he2016deep}. CNN is initially introduced in \cite{lecun1989handwritten}. CNN  is based on hierarchical learning of the convolutional kernels which organized in  layers \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}. The function of lower order layers is to learn low level features such as edges and corner points \cite{zeiler2014visualizing}. Higher order layers learn a high level features such as objects \cite{zeiler2014visualizing}. Typical CNN architecture is a number of convolutional layers that is connected sequentially \cite{simonyan2014very}. This sequential connection of the layers does not scale well for deep CNN \cite{he2016deep}. CNN shows a great performance when it has large number of layers \cite{he2016deep}. To allow CNN to take the advantage of deep architecture, residual connections are used \cite{he2016deep}. Residual connections solve the vanishing gradient problem when gradients approach zeros. Also, residual connections allow the reuse of earlier features \cite{huang2017densely}. Layers with  residual connections are easier to optimize than plain layers as it can easily approximate the identity mapping \cite{he2016deep}. In this thesis CNN is used to automated and accelerate the diagnosing pipeline of the COVID-19. 

\section{Detection Challenges}
Like many computer vision problem COVID-19 has the following challenges
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Availability of Data.} CNN is a deep learning technique that require large number of a training Images. However, current COVID-19 dataset are small-size dataset which is a challenging to train large networks with. 
\item \textbf{Scale.} Like many computer vision models CNN is scale variant. CNN can not recognize images with scales different from the scales in it trained on.
\item \textbf{Vanishing Gradient Problem.} Deep CNN suffer vanishing gradient which prevent CNN parameters to be updated.
\item \textbf{Exploding Gradient Problem.} Deep CNN suffer Exploding gradient which make CNN diverge.
\end{itemize}
Proposed Systems try to overcome these problems as will be detailed in chapters \ref{chp:proposed1} and \ref{chp:proposed2}.
